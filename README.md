COMPUTER-VISION APP

This is the back end component for the front end component (computer-vision) which uses Clarifia's API in order to detect faces in pictures. All the information gathered is then stored in a PostgSQL database(user information, encrypted password)

This component was created using Node.js along with the following dependencies:
  - express
  - nodemon
  - bcrypt
  - body-parser
  - knex
  - pg (PostgreSQL for Node.js)
  
 Try it for your self and see if it can really find people in photos.
